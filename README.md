# Design and Deploy a Highly Available Web Application with 3-Tier Architecture Using Terraform and AWS

This README.md provides a guide for designing and deploying a highly available web application with a 3-tier architecture using Terraform and AWS services like EC2, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing. The implementation focuses on best practices for redundancy and fault tolerance. The primary technologies involved include EC2, Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), Route 53, RDS (Relational Database Service), and S3 for static assets.

## Introduction
A highly available web application requires a robust and redundant infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted service to users. The 3-tier architecture comprises a presentation tier, application tier, and a data tier. We'll use Terraform to provision the necessary AWS resources.

## Architecture Overview
Our architecture consists of the following components:

- **Presentation Tier**: EC2 instances serve as web servers.
- **Application Tier**: EC2 instances with the application logic.
- **Data Tier**: RDS for the database.



## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have:

- An AWS account.
- Terraform installed and configured.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and Terraform.

## Steps to Deploy
Let's walk through the steps to deploy this architecture using Terraform.

### 1. Terraform Setup
Ensure that Terraform is set up and configured to work with your AWS account.

### 2. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Define a VPC with public and private subnets using Terraform. Set up network ACLs, security groups, and route tables for proper network segregation and security. Here's an example Terraform code snippet:

```hcl
# Define VPC, subnets, and network configurations
resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  # ...
}

# Create public and private subnets
resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block              = "10.0.0.0/24"
  availability_zone       = "us-east-1a"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  # ...
}
# ...
```

### 3. EC2 Instances
Launch EC2 instances for both the presentation and application tiers using Terraform. Ensure that the EC2 instances in the presentation tier are in the public subnet, while the application tier instances are in the private subnet. Secure them with appropriate security groups. Example Terraform code for EC2 instances:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "presentation_server" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id
  # ...
}

# Define security group for EC2 instances
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name        = "web-sg"
  description = "Security group for web servers"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  # ...
}
# ...
```

### 4. Auto Scaling
Implement Auto Scaling for the application tier EC2 instances using Terraform. Define scaling policies based on CPU utilization or other metrics to handle traffic fluctuations automatically.

### 5. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) using Terraform to distribute incoming traffic to the presentation tier EC2 instances. Configure health checks and ensure that it routes traffic to healthy instances.

### 6. Route 53
Use Terraform to manage AWS Route 53 for DNS management. Configure a public hosted zone to route traffic to the ALB. Implement health checks and failover policies for fault tolerance.

### 7. RDS (Relational Database Service)
Set up RDS as your data tier using Terraform. Ensure it's in a private subnet for security. Implement Multi-AZ deployments for database redundancy and automatic failover. Example Terraform code for RDS:

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "my_db" {
  allocated_storage    = 20
  storage_type         = "gp2"
  engine               = "mysql"
  engine_version       = "5.7"
  instance_class       = "db.t2.micro"
  name                 = "mydb"
  username             = "admin"
  password             = "secretpassword"
  multi_az             = true
  # ...
}
```

### 8. S3 for Static Assets
Store static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) in an Amazon S3 bucket. Configure it for public access and enable versioning for backup and rollbacks.

## Security
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit for all relevant services.
- Implement strong IAM policies and access control.
- Regularly update and patch your EC2 instances and RDS database.

## Monitoring and Scaling
- Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and set up alarms.
- Implement Auto Scaling for the application tier to dynamically adjust the number of instances.
- Periodically review and optimize your architecture for performance and cost.

## Cost Optimization
- Leverage Reserved Instances for cost savings.
- Utilize AWS Trusted Advisor to get cost optimization recommendations.
- Remove any unused or over-provisioned resources.

## Conclusion
Deploying a highly available web application on AWS with a 3-tier architecture using Terraform is a complex but necessary task to ensure reliability, redundancy, and fault tolerance. Following best practices and regular maintenance will help you maintain a robust infrastructure for your web application.
